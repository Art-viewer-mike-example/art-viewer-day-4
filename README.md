# art-viewer-day-4
Day 4 depends on how you did yesterday.

If you did not meet your MVP, take today to get it ready. Remember, you can style a functional MVP and you'll still be in good shape.

If you completed your MVP, today should be all about adding new features! Try to focus on actual functionality, but if you'd like you can spend a little of today working on some CSS factors that might take more time (like animations or complex designs).

No matter what though, today should add be about making improvements over yesterday. And really, don't go crazy with CSS and polish, that's what tomorrow is for!
